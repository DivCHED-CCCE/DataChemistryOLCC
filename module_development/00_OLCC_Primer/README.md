# Python Primer
This directory is set up to develop a variety of Python tutorials to assist students in learning Python skills they will use in later modules. Discussions of these tutorials will take place in the [00_Python_Primer Forum](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce/forum/module-development/0-general-discussion-and-information) of the MODULE DEVELOPMENT category of the nanoHUB [CCCE OLCC Working Group](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce/forum). Please contact Bob Belford (rebelford@ualr.edu) if you would like to join the working group, contribute content to this repository, or have any questions or concerns about this project.

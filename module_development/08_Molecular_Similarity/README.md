# Module 8: Molecular Similarity
This module is under construction and is being discussed in the CCCE Working Group forum of the [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org//).  Contact Bob Belford if you would like access to the working group at **rebelford@ualr.edu**. These notebooks are modifications of the 2019 Cheminformatics OLCC lecture 6 on Molecular Similarity originally developed by Sunghwan Kim.  This update is being spearheaded by Ehren Bucholtz (ehren.Bucholtz@uhsp.edu), whom you should contact if you want to contribute to this module or be granted access to the keys.

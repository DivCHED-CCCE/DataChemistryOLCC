# Module Development
This site is designed to support collaborative module development and is under construction. The modules are being discussed in the [Module Development](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce/forum) forum of the [CCCE OLCC Working Group](https://nanohub.org/groups/ccce) of the [nanoHUB](https://nanohub.org//), and mirrors how the modules will be discussed with students across campuses when the course is offered.  

Each module will contain Jupyter notebooks and a variety of files that go with the notebooks. There will also be a readme file that functions as the module's landing page and will contain links to the module's discussion forum in nanoHUB. There will also be a "Notebook Outlines" section for each notebook that breifly describes the notebook content and who to contact if you have questions, concerns or wish to be involved with reviewing or developing the notebook.  Keys will not be posted here and you will need to request access from the content developer.

Contact Bob Belford (rebelfordz@ualr.edu) if you would like access to the working group. This site is only for development purposes and another site will be built to run the course. Select notebooks will be uploaded to a nanoHUB tool that will allows students to run the notebook without having to install the packages on their local machine when the course is offered.

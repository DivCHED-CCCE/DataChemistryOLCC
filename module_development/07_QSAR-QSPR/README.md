# Quantitative Structure Property Relationship Notebook

This is an update of the 2019 QSPR notebook. I have added "check your understanding" prompts and an extra credit assignment that could be
easily adapted to make a nice Machine Learning and Fingerprint project for students who may not be as interested in predicting biological
 activity of molecules. The dataset already has molecules split into training and test set and I only used the training set for this assignment.

Details of attached files:
1. QSPRUpdate2025.ipynb
   - The updated student notebook
2. QSPRUpdate2025Key.ipynb
   - The updated instructor notebook. This has additional information for instructors as well as code for the homework assignments.
3. BP.csv
   - This is the original 30 molecule BP dataset for predicting BP.
4. 102BP.csv
   - This is required for Assignment 1 of the homework. It is 102 molecules in the dataset.
5. JCIM_2016_physicochemical_properties.pdf
   - This is a 2016 paper to predict multiple properties. It was ML with fingerprints, but you can see how I used this to create the extra credit assignment.
6. BP_JCIM2016_4074.csv
   - This is the dataset required for the extra credit assignment.

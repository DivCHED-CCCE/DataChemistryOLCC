# Module3: Chemical Representation
This directory is set up to develop a variety of Python tutorials to assist students in learning Python skills they will use in later modules. Discussions of these tutorials will take place in the [Chemical Representation GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/DivCHED-CCCE/DataChemistryOLCC/discussions/categories/03-chemical-representation). Please contact Bob Belford (rebelford@ualr.edu) if you would like to join the working group, contribute content to this repository, or have any questions or concerns about this project.

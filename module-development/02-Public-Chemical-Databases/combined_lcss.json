PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Gives the same product with chlorine. Can react explosively with isocyanates under basic conditions. The presence of an inert solvent mitigates this reaction [Wischmeyer 1969]. A violent exothermic reaction occurred between methyl alcohol and bromine in a mixing cylinder [MCA Case History 1863. 1972].

The amount of heat that is evolved per mole of amine in a neutralization is largely independent of the strength of the amine as a base. Amines may be incompatible with isocyanates, halogenated organics, peroxides, phenols (acidic), epoxides, anhydrides, and acid halides.

Following the dreadful accident, Seibert remembers remarking that the explosion must have been caused by wet methanol and warns about the dangers of adding sodium azide to wet methanol.  Because no further details about the contents of the reactor are given, there is nothing I can say about it but to clarify that NaN3 does not form explosive compounds when dissolved in water. Besides its toxicity, the danger associated with NaN3 is its ability to form explosive azides when reacted with heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, or nickel.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

                        "String": "\"Chemists at Merck & Co. were performing experiments using nitric oxide at high pressure (10\u201320 bar) when two instances of an explosion occurred during rapid depressurization of the NO headspace from a 500-mL closed reactor system. No injuries occurred, and damage was contained to the barricaded cell area. Both before and in between these events, NO had been used successfully about 100 times. Each explosion occurred after completion of the reaction, while venting through three-eighths- or one-quarter-inch i.d. Teflon-lined steel-braided tubing to atmospheric pressure.  Static electricity was suspected as the ignition source that, in conjunction with the presence of an oxidant (NO) and fuel (CH3OH), would lead to combustion. To confirm this hypothesis, an investigation was conducted. Preliminary results are communicated here.  The reaction system consisted of NO in conjunction with methanol under basic conditions. A literature search didn\u2019t point to any existing cautionary notes about this reaction. Experimental ignition testing of NO systems was conducted by Fauske & Associates, which showed no combustion unless ignition energy greater than 3 J was used. This exceeds the energy typical of a static discharge, so it does not fully explain the observed combustion. Further analysis of the reaction headspace using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that N2O was formed over time from a simple model system of NO + sodium methoxide + methanol. The conversion of NO to N2O and concomitant oxidation of methanol to formic acid proceeds to 50% in about six hours. Testing showed the energy needed to ignite the headspace of methanol under 1 bar of 50/50 NO/N2O is less than 3 mJ, several orders of magnitude lower than for similar systems without N2O. On the basis of these results, the likely cause of the explosions is the combination of (a) formation of N2O gas and (b) generation of static potential caused by the rapid flow of gas and condensing methanol through the Teflon-lined tubing during rapid depressurization (while venting), which leads to sparking of sufficient energy to cause the combustible vapor to ignite.  We wanted to alert the chemical process industry to risks associated with this particular procedure. Anyone contemplating use of this chemistry should thoroughly evaluate its safety. \" (reprint of full text)",

                            "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Methanol is a clear colorless liquid, used in hydraulic fracturing mixtures. It is also used as dehydrator of natural gas; fuel for utility plants (methyl fuel); feedstock for manufacture of synthetic proteins by continuous fermentation; source of hydrogen for fuel cells, home-heating-oil extender. HUMAN STUDIES: Humans (and non-human primates) are uniquely sensitive to methanol poisoning. Nearly all of the available information on methanol toxicity in humans relates to the consequences of acute rather than chronic exposures. A vast majority of poisonings involving methanol have occurred from drinking adulterated beverages and from methanol-containing products. The minimum lethal dose of methanol in the absence of medical treatment is between 0.3 and 1 g/kg. Wide interindividual variability of the toxic dose is a prominent feature in acute methanol poisoning. Two important determinants of human susceptibility to methanol toxicity appear to be (1) concurrent ingestion of ethanol, which slows the entrance of methanol into the metabolic pathway, and (2) hepatic folate status, which governs the rate of formate detoxification. The symptoms and signs of methanol poisoning, which may not appear until after an asymptomatic period include visual disturbances, nausea, abdominal and muscle pain, dizziness, weakness and disturbances of consciousness ranging from coma to clonic seizures. Visual disturbances range from mild photophobia and misty or blurred vision to markedly reduced visual acuity and complete blindness. In extreme cases death results. The principal clinical feature is severe metabolic acidosis of the anion-gap type. ANIMAL STUDIES: The rate of metabolic detoxification, or removal of formate is vastly different between rodents and primates and is the basis for the dramatic differences in methanol toxicity observed between rodents and primates. The acute and short term toxicity of methanol varies greatly between different species, toxicity being highest in species with a relatively poor ability to metabolize formate. In such cases of poor metabolism of formate, fatal methanol poisoning occurs as a result of metabolic acidosis and neuronal toxicity, whereas, in animals that readily metabolize formate, consequences of CNS depression (coma, respiratory failure) are usually the cause of death. Overall methanol has a low acute toxicity to non-primate animals. In the rabbit, methanol is a moderate irritant to the eye. It was not skin sensitizing. The association between methanol exposure and lymphoma in some animal studies is weak, and is better interpreted as due to confounding factors or to a mechanism not relevant in humans. The inhalation of methanol by pregnant rodents throughout the period of embryogenesis induces a wide range of concentration-dependent teratogenic and embryolethal effects. Treatment-related malformations, primarily extra or rudimentary cervical ribs and urinary or cardiovascular defects, were found in fetuses of rats. Increased incidences of exencephaly and cleft palate were found in the offspring of mice. No increase in micronuclei was observed in the bone marrow of mice exposed to methanol. Methanol did not induce micronuclei in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells in vitro. Methanol was mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay, in a Basc test, or in Drosophila, sex-linked, recessive lethal mutation assay. Treatment of primary cultures of Syrian golden hamster embryo cells with methanol did not lead to cell transformation. Methanol was not mutagenic to Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, TA1535, TA 1537, and TA1538 in Ames tests with or without metabolic activation. Equivocal results were obtained with Salmonella strain TA102 in the presence of metabolic activation. Methanol was not mutagenic in a DNA-repair test using various strains of E. coli WP2 and in a forward mutation assay using Schizosaccharomyces pombe. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES:  Methanol is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms, and effects due to environmental exposure to methanol are unlikely to be observed, except in the case of a spill.",

This includes methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol. Methanol is among the most dangerous toxic alcohols, potentially producing significant morbidity and mortality in heavily exposed individuals who are left untreated. It is found in various household and industrial agents, and methanol poisoning may be due to accidental or intentional ingestions. Accidental poisonings have been due to distillation and fermentation errors, and as the result of beverage contamination. Examples of products that contain methanol include windshield wiper fluid, industrial solvents, some types of antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, etc. The exposures to methanol can cause varying degrees of toxicity and the management strategies range from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatment is fomepizole, and ethanol may be administered if fomepizole is not an option.",

In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into ... formaldehyde /and other products/. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. To test the role of ADH in the maintenance of low methanol concentration in the plasma, we used the specific ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and showed that intraperitoneal administration of 4-MP resulted in a significant increase in the plasma methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde concentrations. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol. ADH in the liver was identified as the main enzyme for metabolizing methanol because an increase in the methanol and ethanol contents in the liver homogenate was observed after 4-MP administration into the portal vein. Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes involved in cell signaling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis.",

While methanol metabolism and toxicology have been best studied in peripheral organs, little study has focused on the brain and no study has reported experimental evidence that demonstrates transformation of methanol into FA in the primate brain. In this study, three rhesus macaques were given a single intracerebroventricular injection of methanol to investigate whether a metabolic process of methanol to FA occurs in nonhuman primate brain. Levels of FA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were then assessed at different time points. A significant increase of FA levels was found at the 18th hour following a methanol injection. Moreover, the FA level returned to a normal physiological level at the 30th hour after the injection. These findings provide direct evidence that methanol is oxidized to FA in nonhuman primate brain and that a portion of the FA generated is released out of the brain cells. This study suggests that FA is produced from methanol metabolic processes in the nonhuman primate brain and that FA may play a significant role in methanol neurotoxicology.",

                            "String": "Methanol is among the most common short-chain alcohols in fermenting fruits, the natural food and oviposition sites of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. Our previous results showed that cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs) were associated with methanol detoxification in the larvae. Catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), esterases (ESTs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were specifically inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethylmeleate (DEM), respectively. CYPs were inhibited by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT). In the present paper, the involvements of these enzymes in methanol metabolism were investigated in female and male adults by determining the combination indices of methanol and their corresponding inhibitors. When PBO, 1-ABT, 3-AT, 4-MP and TPP were individually mixed with methanol, they exhibited significant synergism to the mortality of the adults after 72 hr of dietary exposure. In contrast, the DEM and methanol mixture showed additive effects. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity and up-regulated mRNA expression levels of several Cyp genes. Bioassays using different strains revealed that the variation in ADH activity and RNAi-mediated knockdown of alpha-Est7 significantly changed LC50 values for methanol. These results suggest that CYPs, catalases, ADHs and ESTs are partially responsible for methanol elimination in adults. It seems that there are some differences in methanol metabolism between larvae and adults, but not between female and male adults.",

In the second step, formaldehyde is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid or formate depending on the pH. In the third step, formic acid is detoxified by a folate-dependent pathway to carbon dioxide. Elimination of methanol from the blood appears to be slow in all species, especially when compared to ethanol. In humans, urinary methanol concentrations have been found to be proportional to the concentration of methanol in blood.",

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is noted that the most severe toxicity occurs many hours following peak blood and tissue methanol concentrations so that these do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of toxicity. Individual differences are seen both in this latent period and in individual susceptibility to methanol. This susceptibility may depend on the activity of folic acid requiring metabolic reactions involved in formate metabolism, formate being an intermediate produced during methanol oxidation and responsible for many toxic effects of methanol. Studies of the characteristics of methanol poisoning in non-primates and monkeys are examined. Despite the ingestion of lethal doses of methanol, non-primates generally do not develop significant metabolic acidosis nor impairment of vision, and no consistent histopathology has been demonstrated in these species. In monkeys, results suggest that the latent period represents a period of compensated metabolic acidosis; when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, blood pH begins to drop. Formate accumulates and produces acidosis in the methanol poisoned monkey, but not in the rat, apparently due to a slower rate of formate metabolism to carbon dioxide in the monkey. ... Studies demonstrating the role of alcohol dehydrogenase in methanol metabolism in the monkey are reported; however, the catalase/peroxidative system which participates in methanol metabolism in rats apparently does not function in the monkey. Formaldehyde and formate metabolism are also examined. The regulation of the rate of formate metabolism is governed by regulation of the hepatic tetrahydrofolate concentrations. ... Further research is needed to determine what step or process it is which places the primate at a distinct liability in the metabolic disposition of one carbon moieties.",

The expression of methanol poisoning is related to the ability of an animal to metabolize formate to carbon dioxide. Since the rate of formate oxidation is related to hepatic tetrahydrofolate content and the activites of folate dependent enzymes, studies were designed to determine hepatic concentrations of hepatic tetrahydrofolate and activites of folate dependent enzymes of human liver and livers of species considered insensitive to methanol poisoning. An excellent correlation between hepatic tetrahydrofolate and maximal rates of formate oxidation has been observed. In human liver, levels were only 50% of those observed for rat liver and similar to those found in monkey liver. Total folate was also lower (60% decreased) in human liver than that found in rat or monkey liver. Interestingly, mouse liver contains much higher hepatic tetrahydrofolate and total folate than rat or monkey liver. This is consistent with higher formate oxidation rates in this species. A second important observation has been made. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of formate oxidation to carbon dioxide, was markedly reduced in both monkey and human liver. Thus, two mechanisms may be operative in explaining low formate oxidation in species susceptible to methanol toxicity, low hepatic tetahydrofolate levels and reduced hepatic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity.",

It has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidase, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in ATP synthesis. Inhibition occurs subsequent to the binding of formic acid to the ferric heme iron of cytochrome oxidase, and the apparent inhibition constant is between 5 and 30 mM. Concentrations of formate present in the blood and tissues of methanol-intoxicated humans, non-human primates and rodent models of methanol-intoxication are within this range. Studies conducted in methanol-sensitive rodent models have revealed abnormalities in retinal and optic nerve function and morphology, consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin. In these animal models, formate oxidation is selectively inhibited by dietary or chemical depletion of folate coenzymes, thus allowing formate to accumulate to toxic concentrations following methanol administration. Methanol-intoxicated rats developed formic acidemia, metabolic acidosis and visual toxicity analogous to the human methanol poisoning syndrome.",

Morphological studies, coupled with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, revealed generalized retinal edema, photoreceptor and /retinal pigment epithelium/ (RPE) vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling and a reduction in cytochrome oxidase activity in photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol intoxicated rats. The most striking structural alterations observed in the retinas of methanol-intoxicated rats were vacuolation and mitochondrial swelling in inner segments of the photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol-intoxicated rats were swollen and expanded to disrupted cristae and showed no evidence of cytochrome oxidase reaction product. In contrast, photoreceptor mitochondria from control animals showed normal morphology with well-defined cristae and were moderately reactive for cytochrome oxidase reaction product. These findings are consistent with disruption of ionic homoeostasis in the photoreceptors, secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial function. Biochemical measurements also showed a significant reduction in retinal and brain cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats relative to control animals. Surprisingly, no differences from control values were observed in hepatic, renal or cardiac cytochrome oxidase activity or ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats. The reduction in retinal function, inhibition of retinal, optic nerve and brain cytochrome oxidase activity, depletion of retinal and brain ATP concentrations, and mitochondrial disruption produced in methanol-intoxicated rats are consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin with selectivity for the retina and brain.",

No information is available on the reproductive, developmental, or carcinogenic effects of methanol in humans. Birth defects have been observed in the offspring of rats and mice exposed to methanol by inhalation. EPA has not classified methanol with respect to carcinogenicity.",

Methanol poisoning after inhalation or skin absorption in the workplace has been reported.

Coma, respiratory failure, and death may ensue. [CHEMINFO] In high-dose reproductive studies in animals, methyl alcohol causes testicular damage and birth defects. [Frazier, p. 179-80] Patients may present with inebriation and gastritis. There is a characteristic latency of 6-30 hours after exposure. Combined osmolar and anion gaps suggest poisoning by methanol or ethylene glycol, but also may occur in severe alcoholic ketoacidosis or diabetic ketoacidosis. [Olson, p. 35, 314-5]",

Leaking containers should be removed to the outdoors or to an isolated, well-ventilated area and the contents transferred to other suitable containers. The following materials are recommended for plugging leaks of methanol: polyester (eg Glad bag), imid polyester (eg brown-in-bag), stafoam urethane foam, sea-going epoxy putty, and MSA urethane.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

                        "String": "\"We would like to report an explosion that occurred in our laboratory last year while performing an oxidative coupling of trimethylsilylacetylene (TMSA) in a Glaser-Hay reaction. The explosion ruptured the 2-L reaction flask and seriously injured a researcher.  This reaction has been routinely used in our and many other laboratories to prepare 1,4-bis(trimethylsilyl)butadiyne-1,3 on a large scale (>100 g), and no dangerous or unusual behavior was previously noted.  The procedure involves purging oxygen through a solution of TMSA in acetone in the presence of a copper(I) chloride:tetramethylethylenediamine complex catalyst at room temperature as described by Andrew B. Holmes et al. (Org. Syntheses 1993, Coll. Vol. 8, 63). The authors of the procedure recommend a safety shield as a general precaution while working with flammable materials in the atmosphere of oxygen, although no hazard was ever encountered. In this incident, the explosion occurred as soon as we started adding the solution of catalyst in acetone to the reaction. We have consulted with the pioneer of this reaction (Allan S. Hay) and the submitting author of the procedure (Holmes) and considered various scenarios to explain the explosion. Ignition of acetone/TMSA vapor by the external sources was hardly possible as the flask was well sealed and the outgoing gases were passed through a dry-ice condenser (lowering the vapor pressure below the explosive concentration) and brought to the back side of the fume hood through a 1-meter hose.  The reaction temperature (5 \u00baC) was noted by the researcher a few seconds before the explosion, thus ruling out unexpected reaction exothermy. The autoignition of the vapor on a hot stirring adapter (possibly heated by rotation-induced friction) was refuted, because joint lubrication was checked before setting up the experiment, and it would have required achieving an unrealistic temperature of greater than 300 \u00baC. Also, the explosion occurred upon adding the first few drops of copper catalyst, which makes crystallization of the explosive intermediate\u2014copper bis(trimethylsilylacetylide)\u2014highly improbable.  We speculate that a discharge of static electricity between the syringe needle and the digital thermometer inside the flask is the most likely cause of this explosion. A digital thermometer connected to a stirring hot plate (IKA) was used in the reaction, and a plastic syringe with a long metal needle was introduced through the same neck. An induced static voltage on the syringe through friction from handling (often observed in Montreal winter indoors while walking or even simply sitting) could then cause a sufficient differential potential on the needle for a discharge spark to occur close to the metallic body of the digital thermometer. The oxygen-rich atmosphere lowers the ignition energy and makes even a weak spark sufficient to cause a fire.  The incident emphasizes once more the potential danger of mixing oxygen gas with flammable solvents or reagents. More important, introducing two conductors into a flask brings a risk of static electricity discharge between the conductors, which is dangerous whenever a flammable solvent is used without inert gas. As wired metal-gauge digital thermometers are used more often in synthetic practice, precautions must be taken to avoid their contact with other metallic (conducting) parts inside the reaction flasks.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

                            "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Acetone is a colorless volatile liquid. It is a solvent for fats, oils, waxes, resins, rubber, plastics, lacquers, varnishes, rubber cements.  It is a versatile reagent in organic synthesis. Acetone is used in manufacturing of coatings, plastics, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics. It is also used in production of other solvents and intermediates including: methyl isobutyl ketone, mesityl oxide, acetic acid (ketene process), diacetone alcohol, bisphenol A, methyl methacrylate, explosives, rayon, photographic films, isoprene. Acetone is not registered for current use in the U.S., but approved pesticide uses may change periodically and so federal, state and local authorities must be consulted for currently approved uses. Acetone has been identified as being used in hydraulic fracturing as a corrosion inhibitor. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Acetone is relatively less toxic than many other industrial solvents; however, at high concentrations, acetone vapor can cause CNS depression, cardiorespiratory failure and death. In children 2 to 3 mL/kg is considered to be toxic. Acute exposures of humans to atmospheric concentrations have been reported to produce either no gross toxic effects or minor transient effects, such as eye irritation. More severe transient effects (including vomiting and fainting) were reported for workers exposed to acetone vapor concentrations for about 4 hr. Acute exposures to acetone have also been reported to alter performances in neurobehavioral tests in humans. Females were reported to suffer menstrual irregularities. Acetone also occurs as a metabolic component in blood, urine and human breath. Acetone is one of three ketone bodies that occur naturally throughout the body. It can be formed endogenously in the mammalian body from fatty acid oxidation. Fasting, diabetes mellitus and strenuous exercise increase endogenous generation of acetone. Under normal conditions, the production of ketone bodies occurs almost entirely within the liver and to a smaller extent in the lung and kidney. Products are excreted in the blood and transported to all tissues and organs of the body where they can be used as a source of energy. ANIMAL STUDIES: Oral LD50 values in adult rats are in the range of 5800-7138 mg/kg.  Mice were given 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, or 50,000 ppm acetone (females) and 1,250, 2,500, 5,000, 10,000, or 20,000 ppm acetone  (males) via drinking water for 13 weeks. Absolute liver weight and liver weight to body weight ratios were significantly increased and absolute spleen weight and spleen weight to body weight ratios were significantly decreased in the females (50,000 ppm). In other experiments, rats were assessed for liver oxidative balance and lipid content after treatments with acetone in water for 28 days. Compared with controls, acetone-treated rats had increased hepatic GSH, hepatic vitamin E, glycemia, cholesterolemia, and hepatic fat, which is similar to the features of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Acetone is not considered to be genotoxic or mutagenic. In a study of pregnant rats and mice exposed to acetone vapor during days 6-19 of gestation, slight developmental toxicity was observed. Reports of other reproductive effects of acetone include observations of testicular effects and changes of sperm quality in rats. Acetone has been used extensively as a solvent vehicle in skin carcinogenicity studies and is not considered carcinogenic when applied to the skin. The avoidance and escape behavior of female rats exposed to 3000, 6000, 12,000, or 16,000 ppm of acetone vapors for 10 days for 4 hr/day were studied. The 3000 ppm exposures had no effect on all exposure days, the 6000 ppm exposure initially inhibited the conditioned avoidance response but not the unconditioned escape response, and the two highest exposures inhibited both responses. Normal responses were obtained after three days of exposure to 6000 and 12,000 ppm, indicating that adaptive changes develop upon repeated exposure. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Acetone was tested with mallard eggs. Fertile eggs were immersed in 0, 10 or 100% acetone for 30 seconds at room temperature on days 3 or 8 of incubation. There were no significant effects with 10% acetone; however, 100% acetone caused a significant decrease in survival, embryonic weight and embryonic length for both exposure groups. It is unknown whether the mortality was due to the toxicity of acetone or to its solvent capabilities.",

Acetone may interfere with the composition of the membranes, altering their permeability to ions. Systemically, acetone is moderately toxic to the liver and produces hematological effects. The renal toxicity may be due to the metabolite, formate, which is known to be nephrotoxic and is excreted by the kidneys. One of the major effects of acetone is the potentiation of the toxicity of other chemicals. Pretreatment with acetone has been shown to potentiate the hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity of carbon tetrachloride and chloroform by inducing particular forms of cytochrome P-450, especially cytochrome P-45OIIE1, and associated enzyme activities.

We attribute this to the washin-washout effect in the airways. The aim was to develop a PBTK-model that explains the behavior of acetone in blood and exhaled air at different levels of physical exercise. The model includes exchange of inhaled solvent vapor with the blood flow via the mucosa and separate compartments to describe working and resting muscles. The developed model was contrasted to a traditional PBTK-model where the conducting airways were regarded as an inert tube. Our model predictions agrees well with experimentally observed acetone levels in both arterial blood and end- and mixed-exhaled air from 26 inhalation experiments conducted with 18 human volunteers at 0, 50, 100 and 150 W workload. In contrast, the inert-tube model was unable to describe the data. The developed model is to our knowledge the first which explains the toxicokinetics of acetone at such various levels of physical exercise. It may be useful in breath monitoring and to obtain more accurate estimates of absorbed dose during inhalation of polar volatiles.",

                            "String": "Acetone, one of the principal ketone bodies elevated during treatment with the ketogenic diet, exhibits anticonvulsant properties that may contribute to the seizure protection conferred by the diet. The anticonvulsant mechanism of acetone is unknown, but it is metabolized to several bioactive substances that could play a role. Acetone and its major metabolites-acetol, 1,2-propanediol, methylglyoxal, and pyruvic acid-were assessed for anticonvulsant activity in two mouse seizure models. Various doses of the substances administered intraperitoneally were characterized for their ability to elevate the threshold for clonic seizures induced by intravenous infusion of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) and for protection against tonic seizures induced by subcutaneous bolus administration of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP). The inverted-screen test was used to assess acute neurological toxicity. Acetone (1-32 mmol/kg, i.p.), in a dose-dependent fashion, elevated the PTZ threshold and conferred protection against 4-AP seizures (ED(50), 26.3 mmol/kg). Effective doses of acetone (10-32 mmol/kg) did not cause motor impairment in the inverted-screen test (TD(50), 45.7 mmol/kg). In doses 10-fold greater than the minimally effective dose ofacetone (3.2 mmol/kg), the metabolites acetol, 1,2-propanediol, and pyruvic acid were inactive in the PTZ model. At higher doses that produced motor impairment, acetol and 1,2-propanediol (but not pyruvic acid) did elevate the PTZ threshold. Methylglyoxal had both proconvulsant and anticonvulsant actions, and had substantial toxicity, producing respiratory distress, motor impairment, and death. None of the acetone metabolites protected against 4-AP seizures. This study confirms the broad-spectrum anticonvulsant properties of acetone and indicates that the seizure protection conferred is unlikely to result from its major metabolic products.",

The methylglyoxal pathway is responsible for the conversion to acetol, acetol to methylglyoxal, & subsequent conversion of methylglyoxal to glucose. The propanediol pathway involves the conversion of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol by an as yet unknown process. L-1,2-propanediol is converted to L-lactaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase, & L-lactaldehyde is converted to L-lactic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Expression of these metabolic pathways in rat appears to be dependent on the induction of /acetone/ oxygenase & acetol monooxygenase by acetone.",

The primary (major) pathway involves hepatic metabolism of acetone to acetol and hepatic metabolism of acetol to methylglyoxal, while two secondary (minor) pathways are partially extrahepatic, involving the extrahepatic reduction of acetol to L-1,2-propanediol. Subsequent conversion of acetol to methylglyoxal in microsomes is catalyzed by acetol monooxygenase (also called acetol hydroxylase), an activity also associated with cytochrome P-450IIE1, and also requires oxygen and NADPH. Methylglyoxal can then be converted to D-glucose by an unidentified pathway, and/or possibly by catalysis by glyoxalase I and II and glutathione to D-lactate, which is converted to D-glucose. Some of exogenous acetone is unmetabolized and is excreted primarily in the expired air with little acetone excreted in urine. (N004)",

AEGLs are used by emergency responders when dealing with chemical spills or other catastrophic exposures.  AEGLs are calculated for five relatively short exposure periods (10 min, 30 min, 1 hr, 4 hr, and 8 hr).  The AEGL \"levels\" are dictated by the toxic effects caused by the exposure, with Level 1 being the least and Level 3 being the most severe.",

When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

If a gas has a vapor density of less than one it will generally rise in air. If the vapor density is greater than one the gas will generally sink in air.",

                            "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Benzene is a clear, colorless liquid with a sweet aromatic odor. It is used mainly as a starting material in manufacturing other chemicals, including detergents, pesticides, plastics and resins, synthetic rubber, aviation fuel, pharmaceuticals, dye, explosives, PCB gasoline, flavors and perfumes, paints and coatings, nylon intermediates, photographic chemicals. HUMAN EXPOSURE AND TOXICITY: Immediate signs and symptoms of exposure to benzene: People who breathe in high levels of benzene may develop drowsiness, dizziness, rapid or irregular heartbeat, headaches, tremors, confusion unconsciousness, death. Eating foods or drinking beverages containing high levels of benzene can cause vomiting, irritation of the stomach, dizziness, sleepiness, convulsions, rapid or irregular heartbeat, death. Long-term (a year or more) exposure to benzene causes harmful effects on the bone marrow, resulting in anemia and excessive bleeding. It can also affect the immune system, increasing the chance for infection. Some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries. Acute deaths from benzene exposure at high concentrations have been due to ventricular fibrillation caused by exertion and release of epinephrine. Benzene causes cancer in humans. A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 233 benzene factories and 83 control factories in 12 cities in China. The benzene cohort and the control cohort consisted of 28,460 benzene exposed workers and 28,257 control workers. The leukemia mortality rate was 14/100,000 person-years in the benzene cohort and 2/100,000 person-years in the control cohort. Most (76.6%) cases of benzene leukemia were of the acute type. The mortality due to benzene leukemia was high in organic synthesis plants followed by painting and rubber synthesis industries. The concentration of benzene to which patients with a leukemia were exposed ranged from 10 to 1000 mg/cu m (mostly from 50 to 500 mg/cu m). Benzene is genotoxic in humans: a significantly increased frequency of chromatid and isochromatid breaks in the cultured lymphocytes of exposed workers has been reported, as well as a significant increase of peripheral blood lymphocyte chromosomal aberrations. Metabolic activation of benzene by rat liver microsomes  induced sister chromatid exchanges and cell division delays in cultured human lymphocytes. Occupational exposure to benzene may occur through inhalation and dermal contact. The general population may be exposed to benzene via inhalation of ambient air, ingestion of food and drinking water, and dermal contact with consumer products containing benzene. ANIMAL TOXICITY STUDIES: Experimental animal studies, both inhalation and oral, also support the evidence that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple organ systems, including the hematopoietic system, oral and nasal cavities, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland. Rats exposed to 3,526-8,224 ppm of benzene in a closed chamber for 15 minutes exhibited an increased number of ectopic ventricular beats. In developmental study, rats exposed to 10, 50, or 500 ppm (32, 160 & 1600 mg/cu m) of benzene for 7 hr/day had low incidence of brain and skeletal defects. Rats exposed continuously to 209.7 ppm for 10 days prior to breeding showed a complete absence of pregnancy. 1/10 rats exposed to 19.8 ppm had resorbed embryos. Genotoxicity studies have demonstrated the induction of chromosomal aberrations in bone-marrow cells from mice, rats, and rabbits treated with single or multiple daily doses of benzene ranging from about 0.2 to 2.0 mL/kg per day given either sc or ip. The major metabolites of benzene are phenol, hydroquinone, and catechol. The route of exposure has little effect on the subsequent metabolism of benzene to hemotoxic metabolites. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: Young Coho salmon mortality was 12/20 at 50 ppm after 24 hr up to 96 hr and 30/30 at 100 ppm after 24 hr in artificial seawater at 8 \u00b0C. Herring and anchovy larvae studies showed that 35-45 ppm caused delay in development of eggs and produced abnormal larvae; 10-35 ppm caused delay in development of larvae, decrease in feeding  and growth, and increase in respiration. Blue crab juveniles when exposed to sublethal concentrations of benzene (0.1 or 5.0 ppm) in a static system showed an increase in the time needed to complete a molt cycle (50 days in case of benzene-exposed crab, as compared to 33 days for controls), a slower rate of growth of regenerating limb buds, and a depressed activity of ATPase in mitochrondria. Oxygen consumption by the crab decreased from exposure to 1.0 ppm benzene.",

Benzene's primary toxic effects are decreases in haematological cell counts and bone marrow cellularity. The decrease in blood cell count may be due to the binding of metabolites such as benzene oxide to the blood proteins albumin and haemoglobin. In the bone marrow, phenolic metabolites can be metabolized by bone marrow peroxidases to highly reactive semiquinone radicals and quinones that stimulate the production of reactive oxygen species. This and direct metabolite binding leads to damage to tubulin, histone proteins, and topoisomerase II. Some metabolites also exert mutagenic effects by inhibiting other DNA associated proteins, such as mitochondrial DNA polymerase and ribonucleotide reductase, as well as covalently binding to DNA itself, causing effects such as strand breakage, mitotic recombination, chromosome translocations, and aneuploidy.

Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is highly flammable and is formed from both natural processes and human activities. Benzene is widely used in the United States; it ranks in the top 20 chemicals for production volume. Some industries use benzene to make other chemicals which are used to make plastics, resins, and nylon and synthetic fibers. Benzene is also used to make some types of rubbers, lubricants, dyes, detergents, drugs, and pesticides. Natural sources of benzene include volcanoes and forest fires. Benzene is also a natural part of crude oil, gasoline, and cigarette smoke.",

Chronic (long-term) inhalation exposure has caused various disorders in the blood, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia, in occupational settings. Reproductive effects have been reported for women exposed by inhalation to high levels, and adverse effects on the developing fetus have been observed in animal tests. Increased incidence of leukemia (cancer of the tissues that form white blood cells) have been observed in humans occupationally exposed to benzene.

After chronic exposure, it can cause aplastic anemia and leukemia.

Under the proposed revised Carcinogen Risk Asessment Guidelines (USEPA, 1996), benzene is characterized as a known human carcinogen for all routes of exposure based upon convincing human evidence as well as supporting evidence from animal studies. Epidemiologic studies and case studies provide clear evidence of a causal association between exposure to benzene and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia and also suggest evidence for chronic nonlymphocytic leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Other neoplastic conditions that are associated with an increased risk in humans are hematologic neoplasms, blood disorders such as preleukemia and aplastic anemia, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and myelodysplastic syndrome. These human data are supported by animal studies. The experimental animal data add to the argument that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple species at multiple organ sites (hematopoietic, oral and nasal, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland). It is likely that these responses are due to interactions of the metabolites of benzene with DNA ... Recent evidence supports the viewpoint that there are likely multiple mechanistic pathways leading to cancer and, in particular, to leukemogenesis from exposure to benzene. HUMAN CARCINOGENICITY DATA: Benzene is a known human carcinogen based upon evidence presented in numerous occupational epidemiological studies. Significantly increased risks of leukemia, chiefly acute myelogenous leukemia, have been reported in benzene-exposed workers in the chemical industry, shoemaking and oil refineries. ANIMAL CARCINOGENICITY DATA:... many experimental animal studies, both inhalation and oral, also support the evidence that exposure to benzene increases the risk of cancer in multiple organ systems, including the hematopoietic system, oral and nasal cavities, liver, forestomach, preputial gland, lung, ovary, and mammary gland ....",

For male mice, benzene caused increased incidences of Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas, malignant lymphomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas and alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas or carcinomas (combined), harderian gland adenomas, and squamous cell carcinomas of the preputial gland. For female mice, benzene caused increased incidences of malignant lymphomas, ovarian granulosa cell tumors, ovarian benign mixed tumors, carcinomas and carcinosarcomas of the mammary gland, alveolar/bronchiolar adenomas, alveolar/bronchiolar carcinomas, and Zymbal gland squamous cell carcinomas. Dose-related lymphocytopenia was observed for male and female F344/N rats and male and female B6C3F1 mice.",

Repeated or prolonged skin contact with liquid benzene can remove the natural oils from the skin, causing it to crack and peel. Repeated exposure to levels of benzene below 200 ppm may cause chronic CNS effects (headache, drowsiness, and nervousness). Chronic benzene exposure in the workplace has been associated with blood (hematologic) disorders, such as low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia), absence of red blood cells (aplastic anemia), and loss of all types of blood cells due to bone marrow damage.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Mixtures with concentrated sulfuric acid and concentrated hydrogen peroxide can cause explosions. Reacts with hypochlorous acid either in water solution or mixed water/carbon tetrachloride solution to give methyl hypochlorite, which decomposes in the cold and may explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Gives the same product with chlorine. Can react explosively with isocyanates under basic conditions. The presence of an inert solvent mitigates this reaction [Wischmeyer 1969]. A violent exothermic reaction occurred between methyl alcohol and bromine in a mixing cylinder [MCA Case History 1863. 1972]. A flask of anhydrous lead perchlorate dissolved in methanol exploded when it was disturbed [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 52:2391. 1930]. P4O6 reacts violently with methanol. (Thorpe, T. E. et al., J. Chem. Soc., 1890, 57, 569-573). Ethanol or methanol can ignite on contact with a platinum-black catalyst. (Urben 1794).",

Following the dreadful accident, Seibert remembers remarking that the explosion must have been caused by wet methanol and warns about the dangers of adding sodium azide to wet methanol.  Because no further details about the contents of the reactor are given, there is nothing I can say about it but to clarify that NaN3 does not form explosive compounds when dissolved in water. Besides its toxicity, the danger associated with NaN3 is its ability to form explosive azides when reacted with heavy metals such as lead, copper, zinc, cadmium, or nickel.\" (reprint of the full-text)",

                        "String": "\"Chemists at Merck & Co. were performing experiments using nitric oxide at high pressure (10\u201320 bar) when two instances of an explosion occurred during rapid depressurization of the NO headspace from a 500-mL closed reactor system. No injuries occurred, and damage was contained to the barricaded cell area. Both before and in between these events, NO had been used successfully about 100 times. Each explosion occurred after completion of the reaction, while venting through three-eighths- or one-quarter-inch i.d. Teflon-lined steel-braided tubing to atmospheric pressure.  Static electricity was suspected as the ignition source that, in conjunction with the presence of an oxidant (NO) and fuel (CH3OH), would lead to combustion. To confirm this hypothesis, an investigation was conducted. Preliminary results are communicated here.  The reaction system consisted of NO in conjunction with methanol under basic conditions. A literature search didn\u2019t point to any existing cautionary notes about this reaction. Experimental ignition testing of NO systems was conducted by Fauske & Associates, which showed no combustion unless ignition energy greater than 3 J was used. This exceeds the energy typical of a static discharge, so it does not fully explain the observed combustion. Further analysis of the reaction headspace using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry revealed that N2O was formed over time from a simple model system of NO + sodium methoxide + methanol. The conversion of NO to N2O and concomitant oxidation of methanol to formic acid proceeds to 50% in about six hours. Testing showed the energy needed to ignite the headspace of methanol under 1 bar of 50/50 NO/N2O is less than 3 mJ, several orders of magnitude lower than for similar systems without N2O. On the basis of these results, the likely cause of the explosions is the combination of (a) formation of N2O gas and (b) generation of static potential caused by the rapid flow of gas and condensing methanol through the Teflon-lined tubing during rapid depressurization (while venting), which leads to sparking of sufficient energy to cause the combustible vapor to ignite.  We wanted to alert the chemical process industry to risks associated with this particular procedure. Anyone contemplating use of this chemistry should thoroughly evaluate its safety. \" (reprint of full text)",

                            "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Methanol is a clear colorless liquid, used in hydraulic fracturing mixtures. It is also used as dehydrator of natural gas; fuel for utility plants (methyl fuel); feedstock for manufacture of synthetic proteins by continuous fermentation; source of hydrogen for fuel cells, home-heating-oil extender. HUMAN STUDIES: Humans (and non-human primates) are uniquely sensitive to methanol poisoning. Nearly all of the available information on methanol toxicity in humans relates to the consequences of acute rather than chronic exposures. A vast majority of poisonings involving methanol have occurred from drinking adulterated beverages and from methanol-containing products. The minimum lethal dose of methanol in the absence of medical treatment is between 0.3 and 1 g/kg. Wide interindividual variability of the toxic dose is a prominent feature in acute methanol poisoning. Two important determinants of human susceptibility to methanol toxicity appear to be (1) concurrent ingestion of ethanol, which slows the entrance of methanol into the metabolic pathway, and (2) hepatic folate status, which governs the rate of formate detoxification. The symptoms and signs of methanol poisoning, which may not appear until after an asymptomatic period include visual disturbances, nausea, abdominal and muscle pain, dizziness, weakness and disturbances of consciousness ranging from coma to clonic seizures. Visual disturbances range from mild photophobia and misty or blurred vision to markedly reduced visual acuity and complete blindness. In extreme cases death results. The principal clinical feature is severe metabolic acidosis of the anion-gap type. ANIMAL STUDIES: The rate of metabolic detoxification, or removal of formate is vastly different between rodents and primates and is the basis for the dramatic differences in methanol toxicity observed between rodents and primates. The acute and short term toxicity of methanol varies greatly between different species, toxicity being highest in species with a relatively poor ability to metabolize formate. In such cases of poor metabolism of formate, fatal methanol poisoning occurs as a result of metabolic acidosis and neuronal toxicity, whereas, in animals that readily metabolize formate, consequences of CNS depression (coma, respiratory failure) are usually the cause of death. Overall methanol has a low acute toxicity to non-primate animals. In the rabbit, methanol is a moderate irritant to the eye. It was not skin sensitizing. The association between methanol exposure and lymphoma in some animal studies is weak, and is better interpreted as due to confounding factors or to a mechanism not relevant in humans. The inhalation of methanol by pregnant rodents throughout the period of embryogenesis induces a wide range of concentration-dependent teratogenic and embryolethal effects. Treatment-related malformations, primarily extra or rudimentary cervical ribs and urinary or cardiovascular defects, were found in fetuses of rats. Increased incidences of exencephaly and cleft palate were found in the offspring of mice. No increase in micronuclei was observed in the bone marrow of mice exposed to methanol. Methanol did not induce micronuclei in Chinese hamster lung V79 cells in vitro. Methanol was mutagenic in the mouse lymphoma assay, in a Basc test, or in Drosophila, sex-linked, recessive lethal mutation assay. Treatment of primary cultures of Syrian golden hamster embryo cells with methanol did not lead to cell transformation. Methanol was not mutagenic to Salmonella strains TA97, TA98, TA1535, TA 1537, and TA1538 in Ames tests with or without metabolic activation. Equivocal results were obtained with Salmonella strain TA102 in the presence of metabolic activation. Methanol was not mutagenic in a DNA-repair test using various strains of E. coli WP2 and in a forward mutation assay using Schizosaccharomyces pombe. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES:  Methanol is of low toxicity to aquatic organisms, and effects due to environmental exposure to methanol are unlikely to be observed, except in the case of a spill.",

This includes methanol, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol. Methanol is among the most dangerous toxic alcohols, potentially producing significant morbidity and mortality in heavily exposed individuals who are left untreated. It is found in various household and industrial agents, and methanol poisoning may be due to accidental or intentional ingestions. Accidental poisonings have been due to distillation and fermentation errors, and as the result of beverage contamination. Examples of products that contain methanol include windshield wiper fluid, industrial solvents, some types of antifreeze, carburetor cleaner, etc. The exposures to methanol can cause varying degrees of toxicity and the management strategies range from close laboratory monitoring to antidotal therapy and dialysis. The primary treatment is fomepizole, and ethanol may be administered if fomepizole is not an option.",

In mammals, methanol is considered a poison because the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) converts methanol into ... formaldehyde /and other products/. However, the detection of methanol in the blood and exhaled air of healthy volunteers suggests that methanol may be a chemical with specific functions rather than a metabolic waste product. Using a genome-wide analysis of the mouse brain, we demonstrated that an increase in blood methanol concentration led to a change in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes primarily involved in detoxification processes and regulation of the alcohol/aldehyde dehydrogenases gene cluster. To test the role of ADH in the maintenance of low methanol concentration in the plasma, we used the specific ADH inhibitor 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP) and showed that intraperitoneal administration of 4-MP resulted in a significant increase in the plasma methanol, ethanol and formaldehyde concentrations. Removal of the intestine significantly decreased the rate of methanol addition to the plasma and suggested that the gut flora may be involved in the endogenous production of methanol. ADH in the liver was identified as the main enzyme for metabolizing methanol because an increase in the methanol and ethanol contents in the liver homogenate was observed after 4-MP administration into the portal vein. Liver mRNA quantification showed changes in the accumulation of mRNAs from genes involved in cell signaling and detoxification processes. We hypothesized that endogenous methanol acts as a regulator of homeostasis by controlling the mRNA synthesis.",

While methanol metabolism and toxicology have been best studied in peripheral organs, little study has focused on the brain and no study has reported experimental evidence that demonstrates transformation of methanol into FA in the primate brain. In this study, three rhesus macaques were given a single intracerebroventricular injection of methanol to investigate whether a metabolic process of methanol to FA occurs in nonhuman primate brain. Levels of FA in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were then assessed at different time points. A significant increase of FA levels was found at the 18th hour following a methanol injection. Moreover, the FA level returned to a normal physiological level at the 30th hour after the injection. These findings provide direct evidence that methanol is oxidized to FA in nonhuman primate brain and that a portion of the FA generated is released out of the brain cells. This study suggests that FA is produced from methanol metabolic processes in the nonhuman primate brain and that FA may play a significant role in methanol neurotoxicology.",

Catalases, alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), esterases (ESTs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) were specifically inhibited by 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT), 4-methylpyrazole (4-MP), triphenyl phosphate (TPP) and diethylmeleate (DEM), respectively. CYPs were inhibited by piperonyl butoxide (PBO) and 1-aminobenzotriazole (1-ABT). In the present paper, the involvements of these enzymes in methanol metabolism were investigated in female and male adults by determining the combination indices of methanol and their corresponding inhibitors. When PBO, 1-ABT, 3-AT, 4-MP and TPP were individually mixed with methanol, they exhibited significant synergism to the mortality of the adults after 72 hr of dietary exposure. In contrast, the DEM and methanol mixture showed additive effects. Moreover, methanol exposure dramatically increased CYP activity and up-regulated mRNA expression levels of several Cyp genes. Bioassays using different strains revealed that the variation in ADH activity and RNAi-mediated knockdown of alpha-Est7 significantly changed LC50 values for methanol. These results suggest that CYPs, catalases, ADHs and ESTs are partially responsible for methanol elimination in adults. It seems that there are some differences in methanol metabolism between larvae and adults, but not between female and male adults.",

In the second step, formaldehyde is oxidized by aldehyde dehydrogenase to formic acid or formate depending on the pH. In the third step, formic acid is detoxified by a folate-dependent pathway to carbon dioxide. Elimination of methanol from the blood appears to be slow in all species, especially when compared to ethanol. In humans, urinary methanol concentrations have been found to be proportional to the concentration of methanol in blood.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

It is noted that the most severe toxicity occurs many hours following peak blood and tissue methanol concentrations so that these do not necessarily provide an accurate indication of toxicity. Individual differences are seen both in this latent period and in individual susceptibility to methanol. This susceptibility may depend on the activity of folic acid requiring metabolic reactions involved in formate metabolism, formate being an intermediate produced during methanol oxidation and responsible for many toxic effects of methanol. Studies of the characteristics of methanol poisoning in non-primates and monkeys are examined. Despite the ingestion of lethal doses of methanol, non-primates generally do not develop significant metabolic acidosis nor impairment of vision, and no consistent histopathology has been demonstrated in these species. In monkeys, results suggest that the latent period represents a period of compensated metabolic acidosis; when compensatory mechanisms are exhausted, blood pH begins to drop. Formate accumulates and produces acidosis in the methanol poisoned monkey, but not in the rat, apparently due to a slower rate of formate metabolism to carbon dioxide in the monkey. ... Studies demonstrating the role of alcohol dehydrogenase in methanol metabolism in the monkey are reported; however, the catalase/peroxidative system which participates in methanol metabolism in rats apparently does not function in the monkey. Formaldehyde and formate metabolism are also examined. The regulation of the rate of formate metabolism is governed by regulation of the hepatic tetrahydrofolate concentrations. ... Further research is needed to determine what step or process it is which places the primate at a distinct liability in the metabolic disposition of one carbon moieties.",

The expression of methanol poisoning is related to the ability of an animal to metabolize formate to carbon dioxide. Since the rate of formate oxidation is related to hepatic tetrahydrofolate content and the activites of folate dependent enzymes, studies were designed to determine hepatic concentrations of hepatic tetrahydrofolate and activites of folate dependent enzymes of human liver and livers of species considered insensitive to methanol poisoning. An excellent correlation between hepatic tetrahydrofolate and maximal rates of formate oxidation has been observed. In human liver, levels were only 50% of those observed for rat liver and similar to those found in monkey liver. Total folate was also lower (60% decreased) in human liver than that found in rat or monkey liver. Interestingly, mouse liver contains much higher hepatic tetrahydrofolate and total folate than rat or monkey liver. This is consistent with higher formate oxidation rates in this species. A second important observation has been made. 10-Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity, the enzyme catalyzing the final step of formate oxidation to carbon dioxide, was markedly reduced in both monkey and human liver. Thus, two mechanisms may be operative in explaining low formate oxidation in species susceptible to methanol toxicity, low hepatic tetahydrofolate levels and reduced hepatic 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase activity.",

It has been shown in vitro to inhibit the activity of cytochrome oxidase, a vital component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain involved in ATP synthesis. Inhibition occurs subsequent to the binding of formic acid to the ferric heme iron of cytochrome oxidase, and the apparent inhibition constant is between 5 and 30 mM. Concentrations of formate present in the blood and tissues of methanol-intoxicated humans, non-human primates and rodent models of methanol-intoxication are within this range. Studies conducted in methanol-sensitive rodent models have revealed abnormalities in retinal and optic nerve function and morphology, consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin. In these animal models, formate oxidation is selectively inhibited by dietary or chemical depletion of folate coenzymes, thus allowing formate to accumulate to toxic concentrations following methanol administration. Methanol-intoxicated rats developed formic acidemia, metabolic acidosis and visual toxicity analogous to the human methanol poisoning syndrome.",

Morphological studies, coupled with cytochrome oxidase histochemistry, revealed generalized retinal edema, photoreceptor and /retinal pigment epithelium/ (RPE) vacuolation, mitochondrial swelling and a reduction in cytochrome oxidase activity in photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol intoxicated rats. The most striking structural alterations observed in the retinas of methanol-intoxicated rats were vacuolation and mitochondrial swelling in inner segments of the photoreceptor cells. Photoreceptor mitochondria from methanol-intoxicated rats were swollen and expanded to disrupted cristae and showed no evidence of cytochrome oxidase reaction product. In contrast, photoreceptor mitochondria from control animals showed normal morphology with well-defined cristae and were moderately reactive for cytochrome oxidase reaction product. These findings are consistent with disruption of ionic homoeostasis in the photoreceptors, secondary to inhibition of mitochondrial function. Biochemical measurements also showed a significant reduction in retinal and brain cytochrome oxidase activity and ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats relative to control animals. Surprisingly, no differences from control values were observed in hepatic, renal or cardiac cytochrome oxidase activity or ATP concentrations in methanol-intoxicated rats. The reduction in retinal function, inhibition of retinal, optic nerve and brain cytochrome oxidase activity, depletion of retinal and brain ATP concentrations, and mitochondrial disruption produced in methanol-intoxicated rats are consistent with the hypothesis that formate acts as a mitochondrial toxin with selectivity for the retina and brain.",

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

A fluorocarbon water foam can be applied to the spill to diminish vapor and fire hazard. Hycar and carbopol, which are absorbent materials, have shown possible applicability for vapor suppression and/or containment of methanol in spill situations. Leaking containers should be removed to the outdoors or to an isolated, well-ventilated area and the contents transferred to other suitable containers. The following materials are recommended for plugging leaks of methanol: polyester (eg Glad bag), imid polyester (eg brown-in-bag), stafoam urethane foam, sea-going epoxy putty, and MSA urethane.",

PubChem uses the Hill system, whereby the number of carbon atoms in a molecule is indicated first, the number of hydrogen atoms second, and then the number of all other chemical elements in alphabetical order. When the formula contains no carbon, all the elements, including hydrogen, are listed alphabetically. Sources other than PubChem may include a variant of the formula that is more structural or natural to chemists, for example, H2SO4 for sulfuric acid, rather than the Hill version H2O4S.",

Mixtures of alcohols with concentrated sulfuric acid and strong hydrogen peroxide can cause explosions. Example: An explosion will occur if dimethylbenzylcarbinol is added to 90% hydrogen peroxide then acidified with concentrated sulfuric acid. Mixtures of ethyl alcohol with concentrated hydrogen peroxide form powerful explosives. Mixtures of hydrogen peroxide and 1-phenyl-2-methyl propyl alcohol tend to explode if acidified with 70% sulfuric acid, [Chem. Eng. News 45(43):73(1967); J, Org. Chem. 28:1893(1963)]. Alkyl hypochlorites are violently explosive. They are readily obtained by reacting hypochlorous acid and alcohols either in aqueous solution or mixed aqueous-carbon tetrachloride solutions. Chlorine plus alcohols would similarly yield alkyl hypochlorites. They decompose in the cold and explode on exposure to sunlight or heat. Tertiary hypochlorites are less unstable than secondary or primary hypochlorites, [NFPA 491 M, 1991]. Base-catalysed reactions of isocyanates with alcohols should be carried out in inert solvents. Such reactions in the absence of solvents often occur with explosive violence, [Wischmeyer(1969)].",

The workers were repeating a recently published preparation of 1,5-diamino-1H-tetrazole by the aqueous diazotization of diaminoguanidine hydrochloride using a single equivalent of nitrous acid (Inorg. Chem. 2005, 44, 4237). After neutralization (pH 8) and evaporation, the desired product is extracted from the inorganic salts with hot ethanol. The ethanol is then evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized from water. The preparation states that the product is pure after the ethanol extraction. Unfortunately, we have found that the ethanol extracts not only the desired product but also a very sensitive side product, 5-azidotetrazole. This side product is produced by either double diazotization of diaminoguanidine or possibly by diazotization of the desired product through the intermediate 1H-tetrazolo[1,5-d]tetrazole. If this procedure is repeated, it is imperative that the ethanol extract not be taken to dryness",

Doherty (University of Washington) drew our attention to a serious explosion in her laboratory during the purification of silver nitrate using the procedure in our book on the \u201cPurification of Laboratory Chemicals\u201d, 2nd ed.; Pergamon: London, 1980, p 520. The following is quoted from her letter: As per your procedure the student was recrystallizing silver nitrate (20 g) from high purity (quartz-distilled, deionized) water (~100 mL) by the dropwise addition of high purity ethanol (~1 mL total). After collection of a first crop of crystals (~7 g), the student, follow- ing normal crystallization procedures, produced a second crop of crystals by concentration of the mother liquor by heating on a steam bath, then dropwise addition of another ~1 mL of ethanol. A contact explosion occurred during collection of the second crop when the student agitated the slurry on a sintered glass frit with a spatula. This explosion was quite violent, shattering the glassware involved and sending large chunks of glass as far as fifteen feet away. Very fortunately, the student was not cut by any of the glass shards; however, the potential for major personal injury was present. We were unaware of this danger, but explosions from silver nitrate and ethanol were known to occur and the haz- ards have been documented [Tully, J, P. News Ed. Chem, Soc.) 1941, 19, 250; Chem. Abstr. 1941, 35, 30928; Garin, D. L.; Henderson, K. 0. J. Chem. Educ. 1970,47, 741; Bretherick, L. \u201cHandbook of Reactive Chemical Hazards\u201d, 3rd ed.; Butterworths: London, 1985, pp 13-14. We are grateful to Professor Doherty for pointing out the dangers of this purification to us, and we should like to inform the chemical community of this grave error in our book. This will be rectified in the third edition.",

The workers were repeating a recently published preparation of 1,5-diamino-1H-tetrazole by the aqueous diazotization of diaminoguanidine hydrochloride using a single equivalent of nitrous acid (Inorg. Chem. 2005, 44, 4237). After neutralization (pH 8) and evaporation, the desired product is extracted from the inorganic salts with hot ethanol. The ethanol is then evaporated and the resulting solid recrystallized from water. The preparation states that the product is pure after the ethanol extraction. Unfortunately, we have found that the ethanol extracts not only the desired product but also a very sensitive side product, 5-azidotetrazole. This side product is produced by either double diazotization of diaminoguanidine or possibly by diazotization of the desired product through the intermediate 1H-tetrazolo[1,5-d]tetrazole. If this procedure is repeated, it is imperative that the ethanol extract not be taken to dryness.\" (reprint of full text)",

The reaction mixture immediately became brownish and was stirred an additional 30 minutes. Potassium hydroxide (1.4 g, 23.7 mmol) was added, followed by 10 mL of ethanol. The precipitate of dark green crystals was filtered off to give the potassium salt (48%), which was stored in a covered flask on the bench. An hour and a half later, it exploded spontaneously, damaging some glass containers.

The compound being synthesized by Katritzky is very similar to the known explosive compound 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3-diol and the unstable compound 2,4,6-trinitrobenzene-1,3,5-triol (see Bretherick\u2019s).  The metal salts of the latter are explosive. Given this literature information, it is reasonable to expect the trinitroso compound to be unstable and explosive. Under these circumstances, synthetic chemistry should be conducted with appropriate controls to prevent an explosion and to limit the size of an energetic event, should one occur.\" (reprint of full text).

                            "String": "IDENTIFICATION AND USE: Ethanol is a clear, colorless, very mobile liquid. It is used in alcoholic beverages in suitable dilutions, and as a reagent in synthetic organic chemistry  and chromatography, as well as industrial and laboratory organic solvent. Other uses are in manufacture of denatured alcohol, pharmaceuticals (rubbing compounds, lotions, tonics, colognes), in perfumery. Octane booster in gasoline. Pharmaceutic aid (solvent). HUMAN STUDIES: Ethanol is a central nervous system (CNS) depressant. It enhances the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at the GABA-A receptor and competitively inhibits the binding of glycine at the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (it disrupts excitatory glutaminergic neurotransmission). Ethanol also stimulates release of other inhibitory neurotransmitters, such as dopamine and serotonin. The most common clinical signs of ethanol toxicosis are ataxia, lethargy, vomiting, and recumbency. In more severe cases, hypothermia, disorientation, vocalization, hypotension, tremors, tachycardia, acidosis, diarrhea, respiratory depression, coma, seizures, and death may occur. Alcohol is directly irritating to the stomach and causes vomiting. High ethanol blood levels also stimulate emesis. The concern with vomiting during intoxication is that at high blood ethanol concentrations, the muscles that control the epiglottis become slow to react or even paralyzed. This increases the risk for aspiration. Ethanol intoxication reduces peripheral oxygen delivery and metabolism and causes mitochondrial oxidative dysfunction, potentially resulting in shock or hypoxia in an acutely intoxicated patient. Hypothermia may result from multiple mechanisms. Peripheral vasodilation, CNS depression, ethanol interference with the thermoregulator mechanism, and/or impaired behavioral responses to a cold environment all lead to a lowered body temperature. Moderate ethanol intake appears to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction and other heart diseases. However, high spirits consumption was associated with increased risk of cancer mortality in women. Consumption of alcoholic beverages (beer, in particular) is associated with an increased risk for rectal but not colon cancer. Beer is a commonly consumed alcoholic beverage among reproductive-age adults. Beer drinking males have an increased risk of contributing to pregnancy waste. Women consume beer before and after pregnancy recognition. Binge drinking appears to be a common drinking behavior, and those who binge drink have an increased risk of impaired fetal growth and offspring behavior. Beer consumption by lactating women might temporarily impair motor function of nursing infants. The rate of ethanol metabolism varies among individuals. Studies of twins indicate that interindividual variability in the rate of ethanol metabolism may be genetically controlled. The main pathway for ethanol oxidation in humans is to acetaldehyde via alcohol dehydrogenase pathway. Acetaldehyde is oxidized further to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase. Asians are known to be sensitive to the health effects of ethanol; the sensitivity has been attributed to different forms of the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. Alcohol ingestion by Asians resulted in marked elevations of blood acetaldehyde levels ranging from 0.4 to 3 mg/L, and individuals developed facial flushing and tachycardia as a direct consequence of elevated blood acetaldehyde levels. ANIMAL STUDIES: A drop full-strength ethanol on rabbit eyes causes reversible injury graded only 3 on a scale of 10 after 24 hr. Application of 70% alcohol to rabbit corneas injures and temporarily loosens the corneal epithelium, but the recovery is complete. When rats were dosed with ethanol by oral gavage with 8 to 15 g/kg/day over 4 months and fed a diet containing 25% of total calories as fat, focal necrosis, inflammation, and fibrosis were observed in the liver. Nine baboons fed ethanol at 50% of total calories developed fatty liver, and four animals developed hepatitis within 9 to 12 months. Rabbits exposed to saturated vapors of ethanol for periods ranging from 25 to 365 days developed cirrhosis of the liver. Rats were given a single intraperitoneal dose of diethylnitrosamine followed by treatment with ethanol in drinking water for 12 to 18 months. Ethanol was an effective promoter of liver tumors. Cynomolgus monkeys administered up to 5 g/kg bw ethanol daily on gestation days 20-150 revealed an increase in pregnancy wastage (abortions and still births) but no structural malformation or facial change. Ethanol, and not acetaldehyde, has been implicated as the causative agent of the teratogenic effects in laboratory animals. Oral coadministration of 100 mg/kg of 4-methylpyrazole, an inhibitor of alcohol dehydrogenase, with 6 g/kg of ethanol intraperitoneally on gestation day 10 dramatically increased the embryotoxicity of ethanol in mice. Ethanol is not mutagenic in Salmonella typhimurium strains TA 97, TA 98, TA 100, TA 1535, TA 1537, or TA 1538 in the presence or absence of metabolic activation. In the presence of a metabolic activation system, ethanol is slightly mutagenic to Salmonella strain TA 102, a strain considered to respond to the presence of oxygen radicals. Ethanol did not induce mutations in mouse lymphoma L5178Y TK+/- cells and did not induce micronuclei in Chinese hamster V79 cells in the absence of metabolic activation. No chromosomal aberrations or sister chromatid exchanges were observed in Chinese hamster ovary cells treated with ethanol. ECOTOXICITY STUDIES: The zebrafish were exposed to different concentrations (control, 0.01, 0.1, and 1%) of ethanol from blastula stage to 144 hour-post-fertilization (hpf). No effect on survival was observed except the 1% ethanol group suffered 89% mortality during 108-120 hpf. No developmental defects were observed at the 0.01 and 0.1% concentrations, but significantly higher deformity rates occurred with 1% ethanol. Hyperactivity and less tortuous swimming paths were observed in all ethanol concentrations.",

Alcohol withdrawal syndrome (AWS) occurs due to abrupt cessation of alcohol consumption after binge drinking or long-term dependence. The signs and symptoms range from mild (eg, anxiety, headache, palpitations) to severe (eg, seizures, delirium tremens). The features of AWS typically arise within 24 hours of discontinuing alcohol consumption. Treatment involves supportive therapy for complaints. Any associated comorbidities should be treated with a 'banana bag' of essential vitamins. Severe AWS is an indication for benzodiazepine administration.",

Ethanol acts in the central nervous system primarily by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing the effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. Ethanol within the human body is converted into acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase. Acetaldehyde is linked to most of the clinical effects of alcohol. It has been shown to increase the risk of developing cirrhosis of the liver and multiple forms of cancer. During the metabolism of alcohol via the respective dehydrogenases, NAD (Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) is converted into reduced NAD. Normally, NAD is used to metabolise fats in the liver, and as such alcohol competes with these fats for the use of NAD. Prolonged exposure to alcohol means that fats accumulate in the liver, leading to the term 'fatty liver'. Continued consumption (such as in alcoholism) then leads to cell death in the hepatocytes as the fat stores reduce the function of the cell to the point of death. These cells are then replaced with scar tissue, leading to the condition called cirrhosis.",

                            "String": "There have been allegations in the courtroom that elevated serum lactic acid in trauma victims can yield a falsely elevated serum ethanol assay. Most hospitals utilize an indirect method of ethanol measurement where a serum sample is added to a mix of alcohol dehydrogenase and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+). This allows any ethanol in the patient's serum to be metabolized to acetaldehyde, and in the process results in the reduction of NAD+ to NADH. NADH is then measured using spectrophotometry. The courtroom allegation stems from the concept that oxidation of lactate to pyruvate by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) results in the same molar-for-molar reduction of NAD+ to NADH, and could therefore theoretically cause patients with elevated lactate and LDH to have a falsely elevated ethanol concentration. Patients with elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations who presented to a university hospital from 20 April 2015 to 13 December 2015 were identified to provide possible test specimens. If a sufficient amount of serum was available, the sample was used to re-run the lactate and LDH concentration simultaneously with an enzymatic ethanol assay. Any samples that had elevated lactic acid and LDH concentrations on this retesting, and also yielded a positive ethanol concentration, were sent for confirmatory gas chromatography testing of ethanol concentrations. A control group of 20 samples with normal lactate and LDH were included. A total of 37 samples were included in the final analysis. Only 4 patients had an elevated enzymatic ethanol concentration, and all 4 also had a measurable GC ethanol concentration. The lactate in this dataset ranged from 2.4 to 24.2 mmol/L, with a mean of 6.53 mmol/L (normal value 0.5-2.2). The LDH ranged from 242 to 8838 U/L with a mean of 1695 U/L (normal value 122-225 U/L). Twenty control samples were run on patients with normal lactate and LDH, none of which yielded a positive enzymatic ethanol result. This data does not support the contention that an elevated LDH and lactate can yield a false positive serum ethanol result as run by enzymatic ethanol assay in live patients presenting to the emergency department.",

Each metabolic step requires NAD+; thus oxidation of 1 mol ethanol (46 g) to 1 mol acetic acid requires 2 mol NAD+ in the liver; indeed, NAD+ availability limits ethanol metabolism to about 8 gr or 10 mL (approximately 170 mmol) per hour in a 70-kg adult, or approximately 120 mg/kg per hour. Thus hepatic ethanol metabolism functionally saturates at relatively low blood levels compared with the high blood ethano levels (BELs) achieved, and ethanol metabolism is a zero-order process (constant amount per unit time). Small amounts of ethanol are excreted in urine, sweat, and breath, but metabolism to acetate accounts to 90-98% of ingested ethanol, mostly owing to hepatic metabolism by ADH and ADLH.",

For example, a drug's mechanism of action could be how it affects a specific target in a cell, such as an enzyme, or a cell function, such as cell growth. Knowing the mechanism of action of a drug may help provide information about the safety of the drug and how it affects the body. It may also help identify the right dose of a drug and which patients are most likely to respond to treatment.",

Ethanol is known to affect a large number of membrane proteins that participate in signaling pathways such as neurotransmitter receptors, enzymes, and ion channels, and there is extensive evidence that ethanol interacts with a variety of neurotransmitters. The major actions of ethanol involve enhancing the inhibitory effects of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) at GABAa receptors and blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate, an excitatory amine acid (EAA) receptor. Animal studies indicate that the acute effects of ethanol result from competitive inhibition of glycine binding to NMDA receptor and disruption of glutamatergic neurotransmission by inhibiting the response of the NMDA receptor. Persistent glycine antagonism and attenuation of glutamatergic neurotransmission by chronic ethanol exposure results in tolerance to ethanol by enhancing EAA neurotransmission and NMDA receptor upregulation. The latter appears to involve selective increases in NMDA R2B subunit concentrations and other molecular changes in specific brain loci. The abrupt withdrawal of ethanol thus produces a hyperexcitable state that leads to the ethanol withdrawal syndrome and excitotoxic neuronal death. GABA-mediated inhibition, which normally acts to limit excitation, is eliminated during ethanol withdrawal syndrome and further intensifies this excitation. In addition, NMDA receptors function to inhibit the release of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and mesolimbic structures, which modulate the reinforcing action of addictive xenobiotics such as ethanol. By inhibiting NMDA receptor activity, ethanol could increase dopamine release from the nucleus accumbens and ventral tegmental area and could thus create dependence. Chronic  ethanol administration also results in tolerance, dependence, and an ethanol withdrawal syndrome, mediated, in part, by desensitization and or downregulation of GABAa receptors.",

The normal response to starvation and depletion of hepatic glycogen stores is for amino acids to be converted to pyruvate. Pyruvate can serve as a substrate for gluconeogenesis, be converted to acetyl-CoA, which can enter the Krebs cycle or can be utilized in various biosynthetic pathways (eg, fatty acid, ketone bodies, cholesterol, and acetylcholine) ... Ethanol metabolism generates NADH, resulting in an excess of reducing potential. This high redox state favors the conversion of pyruvate to lactate, diverting pyruvate from being a substrate for gluconeogenesis. To compensate for the lack of normal metabolic substrates, the body mobilizes fat from adipose tissue and increased fatty acid metabolism as an alternative source of energy. This response is mediated by a decrease in insulin and an increased secretion of glucagon, catecholamines, growth hormone, and cortisol. Fatty acid metabolism results in the formation of acetyl-CoA and it combines with the excess acetate that is generated from ethanol metabolism to form acetoacetate. Most of the acetoacetate is reduced to beta-hydroxybutyrate due to the excess reducing potential or high redox state of the cell. Volume depletion interferes with the renal elimination of acetoacetate and beta-hydroxybutyrate, and contributes to the acidosis. An elevated lactate concentration may result from shunting from pyruvate or from hypoperfusion or infection that may coexist with the underlying ketoacidosis.",

Ethanol, probably through its metabolite, acetate, prevents adenosine uptake, raising synaptic adenosine concentrations. Excessive stimulation of several adenosine receptors in the cerebellum may explain much of the motor impairment from low ethanol concentrations. In fact, animals made tolerant to ethanol develop cross-tolerance to adenosine agonists. In mice, adenosine receptor agonists increase ethanol-induced incoordination while adenosine antagonists decrease this intoxicating response.",

To evaluate the mechanism underlying these changes, /the authors/ measured the steady state levels of the mRNAs for the alpha 1, alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5, and alpha 6 subunits of the GABAA receptor after chronic ethanol administration to rats and ethanol withdrawal for 24 hr. The results indicated that chronic ethanol administration resulted in a 61% decline in the level of the GABAA receptor alpha 1 subunit mRNAs [3.8 and 4.3 kilobases (kb)] in the cerebral cortex in rats. The levels of the alpha 2 subunit mRNAs (6 and 3 kb) and the alpha 5 subunit mRNA (2.8 kb) were also reduced, by 61, 45, and 51%, respectively, whereas there was no change in the level of the alpha 3 subunit mRNA (3 kb). Furthermore, the ethanol-induced decrease in receptor mRNA levels persisted for 24 hr, after withdrawal of ethanol and returned to control values at 36 hr of withdrawal. alpha 1 mRNA levels in cerebellum also decreased by 28%. The level of the alpha 6 subunit mRNA, which selectively encodes Ro15-4513 binding sites, was found to be increased by approximately 76% in the cerebellum. Also, the photoaffinity labeling studies using [3H]Ro15-4513 indicated an increase in the levels of various protein components of the GABAA receptor, in the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex (e.g., 50- and 55-kDa proteins in the cerebellum and 41- and 50-kDa proteins in the cortex), after chronic ethanol treatment. The increase in alpha 6 mRNA in the cerebellum might be related to the increased labeling of the 55-kDa (approximately 56-kDa) protein and partially responsible for the increased binding ... . Because the alpha 6 subunit is not expressed in cortex, involvement of an as yet unknown subunit in this region cannot be ruled out. The effect of chronic ethanol treatment appears to be specific for GABAA receptor subunit mRNAs, because the same treatment did not alter the levels of glyceraldehyde-3-dehydrogenase mRNA or poly(A)+ RNA. In summary, these data indicate that chronic ethanol treatment results in an alteration in the regulation of expression of GABAA receptor subunit-encoding mRNAs, which could be due to alterations in transcription or mRNA stability.",

MAC defines 5 as, Substances with carcinogenic and genotoxic effects, the potency of which is considered to be so low that, provided the MAK and BAT values are observed, no significant contribution to human cancer risk is to be expected.

The long-term exposure (also called chronic exposure) is continuous or repeated contact with a toxic chemical over a long period of time (months or years). If a chemical is used every day on the job, the exposure would be chronic. Over time, some chemicals, such as PCBs and lead, can build up in the body. Chronic exposures can also occur at home. Some chemicals in household furniture, carpeting or cleaners can be sources of chronic exposure.",

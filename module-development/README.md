# Module Development
This site is designed to support collaborative module development and is under construction. The modules are being discussed in the [Module Development](https://github.com/DivCHED-CCCE/DataChemistryOLCC/discussions) forum of this github repository, and mirrors how the modules will be discussed with students across campuses when the course is offered.  

Each module will contain Jupyter notebooks and a variety of files that go with the notebooks. There will also be a readme file that functions as the module's landing page and will contain links to each modules discussion forum. Keys will not be posted here and you will need to request access from the content developer.

Contact Bob Belford (rebelford@ualr.edu) if you would like further information. This site is only for development purposes and another site will be built to run the course.
